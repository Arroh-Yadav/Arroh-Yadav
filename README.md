# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Arroh Yadav

I'm currently a first-year BTech undergraduate student passionate about frontend development. My strongest skillset is in the MERN stack, and I love creating engaging web experiences.

My favorite project so far is [Majour-Project](https://github.com/Arroh-Yadav/Majour-Project), which I'm continually improvingâ€”it truly means a lot to me.

I'm committed to personal growth and won't stop until I become the best version of myself, both technically and personally. Although I sometimes feel exhausted from working intensely on my development skills and mastering DSA, I believe persistence pays off.
